## Presentation architecture and project hosts

- Capability/source key: `liberusoftware/integrations`.
- Actual Composer identity: `liberusoftware/integrations-filament`.
- [Filament capability plan](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/boilerplate/filament/integrations.md) · [Filament standard](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/standards/FILAMENT.md) · [Module architecture](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/architecture/MODULES.md).

The application owns panel composition, routing, session integration and deployment. This module owns its focused presentation and delegates domain behavior to reviewed public owner contracts. Keep host App aliases, duplicate records and client-only authorization outside reusable package boundaries.
